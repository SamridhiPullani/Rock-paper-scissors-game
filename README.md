DURATION: 4 WEEKS

Iâ€™ve developed a Python-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game that allows users to interactively play against the computer through a simple and intuitive command-line interface. The program incorporates random computer moves, user input handling, and logical conditions to determine round outcomes. It also includes a score tracking feature for multiple rounds and an option to replay, making it an engaging and educational mini-project. This task helped reinforce my understanding of conditionals, loops, functions, and user interaction in Python.
